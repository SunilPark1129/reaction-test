3. When the screen turns green, now you need to press the screen as soon as possible.<br>When it becomes green, it will save the current time immediately by using ```const startedTime = Date.now()```.<br>Then once you press the green screen, it will calculate the time by using ```Date.now() - startedTime``` to find the reaction time.<br>
